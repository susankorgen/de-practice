# de-practice

Data Engineering 4-day exercise.

The simplest way to run `main.py` and `test_main.py` is from within PyCharm. 
The way I set this up is to use GitHub Desktop, clone the repo,
choose `Respository > Open in PyCharm`, and also create Python 
run configurations for `main.py` and `test_main.py`. 

There are 
a few packages that your PyCharm environment will need to have, such
as pandas and tabulate, but they are all quite common. 
You might already have them installed.
